# What's this?
This is a fork of the excellent Java LHA library Ver 0.26  March 30 2001 by TURNER.

It's a great library, but sadly the code base is quite old.

I have use for this library in a modern Java project using Quarkus, therefore I had to make some changes to this libary in order to make it play nice with modern Java techniques.

# Changes from TURNER's original code

- The project got transformed from an Eclipse Project to a Maven project - which makes it a lot easier to use in modern project.
- The binary is now built using Java 11. The original japanese README mentioned JDK 1.1
